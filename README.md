# Tonic
Tonic is my foundational piano.
As a beginner learning to compose, I constantly found myself pausing my workflow to look up the major and minor scale formulas for different notes. I needed a tool that was fast, visual, and always available.  

I built TONIC to be that tool: where I could instantly visualize scale structures and keep my creative momentum going. It's my handy reference.

*You may need to try refreshing and plugging in and out a few times to connect the MIDI keyboard.*  
*In my case, the Novation Launchkey 61 MK4 worked successfully.*
